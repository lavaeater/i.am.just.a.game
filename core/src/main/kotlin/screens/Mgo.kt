            So the residential / commercial aspect of a block could be ignored and we could just handle
            overlapping instead. Which we can handle easily by making everything the same goddamned size.

            So, all blocks contain width / size items and we just need to determine proportions for them.

            The graph is a pure and beautiful thing. It will describe a grid. Some nodes will have
            places attached to them. So, these nodes will be in the middle of a "grid" of several other nodes:

            Maybe we should create the graph using a weird recursive algorithm where we create nodes as we go and connect
