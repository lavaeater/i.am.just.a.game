            Goal: Non-overlapping, not so boring structure
            Areas are city blocks. They start with a travel hub

            So the residential / commercial aspect of a block could be ignored and we could just handle
            overlapping instead. Which we can handle easily by making everything the same goddamned size.

            So, all blocks contain width / size items and we just need to determine proportions for them.
            Oh la la.
